I love contributing to Kaggle as a data scientist because it allows me to continuously learn and improve my skills through real-world challenges and competitions. I have also been fortunate enough to earn a few medals in these competitions and have enjoyed sharing my knowledge and insights through kernel sharing. Participating in Kaggle has been a great way for me to further my development as a data scientist and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in the field.
